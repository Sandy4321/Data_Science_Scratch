This is a sample text file for counting the most common words. The purpose of this file is for testing only. The most common words script should be able to count the n most common words that appear in this file. I also want to see if I can do this operation with standard command line functions. This I will have to look up becasue I am not sure how to do this. It could be that there is a simple way but I will have to check. I'm not sure if I have written enough lines of text in this file so I will keep going for just a little while longer.
